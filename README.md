# P6 - Data Visualization
## Prospect Loan data visualization
**Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree Project6 submission**


#### Summary
This Project creates chart showing % of loan-status values by their Prosper score and income range values. 
It uses dimple.js for creating the main chart, and also uses D3 to set overall attributes.  This chart has interactive legend, which can be used to filter out loan-status values.

#### Feedback
Following are the feedback I collected from 3 individuals:
 * **Person 1:** 
 	1) Income Range values are not ordered (from lower to higher income), so it is difficult to follow loan-status values based on income.
    2) Bad Loan has green color and Completed loan has red color, which is exactly opposite of what it should be. Most peoplke associate Red with 'Bad', and green with 'Good'.
    
* **Person 2:**
	1) Should add some kind of header, and descriptive sub-header, as well as legend title.
    2) Will be nice if user can play around with different filters.
    
* **Person 3:**
	1) The x-axis is confusing. It has two dimensions (Prosper-Score and Income-Range), however, only values for Prosper Score is labeled in the axis (1-11). Values for Income Range is not labeled, so it is hard to associate a bar with an Income Range. 
    2)
